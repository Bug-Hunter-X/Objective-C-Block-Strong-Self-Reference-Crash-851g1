In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management and object lifecycles, specifically related to retaining objects within blocks or other asynchronous operations.  The problem often manifests when a block retains a strong reference to an object (self, for example) that's already being deallocated, leading to unexpected crashes or memory leaks.  Consider the following example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
- (void)myMethod;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)myMethod {
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{ 
        // Strong self reference inside the block!
        [self.myString length]; // Potential crash here if self is deallocated
    });
}
@end
```

The issue is that the block retains 'self'. If `myMethod` completes and `self` is deallocated before the block executes, accessing `self.myString` will likely cause a crash.
