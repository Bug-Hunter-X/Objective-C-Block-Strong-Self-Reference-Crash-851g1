# Objective-C Block Strong Self Reference Crash

This repository demonstrates a common Objective-C bug involving strong self-references within blocks, which can lead to crashes after an object is deallocated.  The example code shows a scenario where a block retains 'self' strongly, and accessing properties after the object is deallocated results in a crash.  A solution is provided to fix the memory management issue by using `__weak` or `__block` modifiers.

## Bug Description
The bug arises when a block retains a strong reference to 'self', creating a strong reference cycle that prevents the object from being deallocated when it should be. The `bug.m` file contains the code demonstrating this problem. Accessing instance variables or methods within the block after `self` has been deallocated results in a crash.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates how to avoid this problem.  The `bugSolution.m` file shows the corrected code by using a weak reference to `self` inside the block. By using `__weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self;`, we create a weak pointer to self that will be automatically set to nil if `self` is deallocated, preventing the crash.  Check for nil and only execute the code if the object is still valid.
